Project 4 - A Store Inventory

This Project uses the knowledged gained in this unit of CSV and File I/O and database ORMS to build a console application that allows a user to interact with data for a store's inventory. The data needs to be cleaned from the CSV file before it is added to thet database. All interactions with the records use ORM methods for viewing records, creating records, and exporting a new CSV backup.
